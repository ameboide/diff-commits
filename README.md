# Git Diff Commits

Userscript that adds some UI to see the diff between 2 commits on GitHub or BitBucket

To use it, first install an extension to handle userscripts (like Greasemonkey for Firefox or Tampermonkey for Chrome) and then install the script [here](https://github.com/ameboide/diff-commits/raw/master/git_diff_commits.user.js)

It should appear as a "D" button next to the links to commits, for example in the "Commits" tab of a pull request. Click on the button next to the first commit and then on the one for the last commit to see the comparison between those 2 (note that bitbucket sorts them newest to oldest while github is oldest to newest, the buttons should be pressed oldest first and newest later)

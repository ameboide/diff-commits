# Git Diff Commits

Userscript that adds some UI to see the diff between 2 commits on GitHub or BitBucket

To use it, first install an extension to handle userscripts (like Greasemonkey for Firefox or Tampermonkey for Chrome) and then install the script [here](https://github.com/ameboide/diff-commits/raw/master/git_diff_commits.user.js)
